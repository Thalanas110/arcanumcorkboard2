# AnonCorkboardThree

This repository contains a Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffold with shadcn-ui and Tailwind.

## Project info

- This is a local development project — no cloud integration is required to run it.

## How to edit and run locally

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Thalanas110/arcanumcorkboard2.git
cd arcanumcorkboard2
```

2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```powershell

## Technologies

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui

## Notes

- If this project contains a `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/`, regenerate the lockfile after removing or changing dependencies by running `npm install`.
- To fully remove any installed packages locally, run `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` (or the Windows equivalent) and then `npm install`.

If you want me to also regenerate the lockfile and remove installed node_modules entries for the removed package, I can do that next (I will not run npm in your environment without your permission).
